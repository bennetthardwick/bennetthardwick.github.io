# Hello!

I'm Bennett Hardwick, a Software Developer living in Brisbane, Australia and working at [Clipchamp](https://clipchamp.com/).

I'm still a full-time student, but you'll barely see me at QUT. Rather, you'll probably find me breaking builds, [ricing Archlinux](https://github.com/bennetthardwick/dotfiles) or coming up with [ideas for apps](https://bennetthardwick.com/projects/app-names/#/) I'm never going to finish.

# Contact Me
I'm not majorly active on social media, so you're better off sending me an email if you want to get in contact. You can find me at `me (at) bennetthardwick (dot) com`
