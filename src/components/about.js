    <h2>Hello, Bennett here.</h2>
    <p>I’m a Software Developer living in Brisbane, working on making cool things in the browser at <a href="https://clipchamp.com">Clipchamp.</a></p>
    <p>I’m still a full-time student, but you’ll barely find me at QUT. Rather, you’ll probably find me breaking builds, ricing Archlinux or coming up with ideas for apps I’m never gonna finish.</p>
    <p>If you'd like to get in contact, you can send me an email at: <code>me at bennetthardwick.com</code></p>
