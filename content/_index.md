## Hello, Bennett here.

I’m a Software Developer living in Brisbane, working on making cool things
in the browser at [Clipchamp.](https://clipchamp.com)

I’m still a full-time student, but you’ll barely find me at QUT. Rather,
you’ll probably find me breaking builds, ricing Archlinux or coming up
with ideas for apps I’m never gonna finish.

If you'd like to get in contact, you can send me an email at: `me at bennetthardwick.com`
