## Hello, Bennett here.

Iâ€™m a software developer living in Mackay, working on making movies the browser at [Clipchamp.](https://clipchamp.com)

When I'm not at work, you'll find me ricing Archlinux, evangelizing Vim and spending hours and hours fighting the borrow-checker in Rust.

If you'd like to get in contact, you can [email me](mailto:me@bennetthardwick.com) or find me on [Github](https://github.com/bennetthardwick) or [Twitter](https://twitter.com/intent/user?screen_name=bennettbackward).
