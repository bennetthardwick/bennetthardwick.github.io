- [34:54] You never want to "create a server connection", you want to "connect to a server". Picture code at the right level, stop describing the assembler version of your code. This is what it takes to connect to a server - offer the reader the right level of abstraction. [#quotes]
- Remember that there is no code faster than no code. - [Taligent], [#quotes]
