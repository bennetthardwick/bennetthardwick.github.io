## What's an exobrain?

Literally an exobrain is a version of your brain that lives outside yourself.
In most cases, this is in the form of a website, a notebook or journal, or some other system where you can easily link together pieces of knowledge.

Unlike other exobrains, I don't intend to track my mood or have a full list of tasks I've done every day.
Instead, I want to try and create a space where I can easily find knowledge.

## Great Examples
