## Shortcodes

[Shortcode documentation](https://gohugo.io/content-management/shortcodes/)

Shortcodes are hugo's version of snippets or functions which can be run inside markdown files.
Since they are not standardised in markdown their use should be limited to ensure [longtermism].

[longtermism]: ./longtermism.md
