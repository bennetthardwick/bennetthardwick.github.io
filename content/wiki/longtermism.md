Longtermism is the idea of building something that's meant to last.
In software you can build something that lasts by using standardised and open technology, and also by not trying to re-invent the wheel (see [Old is the New New]).

If you're interested in a better explanation, xxiivv's [notes on Longtermism and sustainability](https://wiki.xxiivv.com/site/longtermism.html) sums it up best.
