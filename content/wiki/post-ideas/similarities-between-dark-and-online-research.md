title: Similarities between Dark and online research
---

I've been seeing some crazy similarities between Dark and researching [exobrains].
Many times I've found out about a concept and thought that it was a "new thing", only to find it has been around for ages and little progress has been made.

Perhaps this article could become something like the "time doesn't equal progress" or something like that?
