title: About

This is a wiki is inspired by the concept of an [exobrain] as well as [longtermism].

It's built using [hugo] but it's source is intended to be easily readable by being completely backed by markdown.
As such, [hugo] syntax that is not supported by common mark (such as [shortcodes]) are used sparingly.
This means that this wiki could be [viewed on Github], or as an [mdbook], or with tool in the future that supports markdown.

The code for this wiki lives in a Github repository ([bennetthardwick/website]) and is free to be forked, copied or stolen.
At the bottom of each page is an "edit on Github" link in case you want to fix anything up.
