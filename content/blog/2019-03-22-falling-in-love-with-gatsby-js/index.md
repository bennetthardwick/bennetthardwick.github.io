There's a new kid on the block and it's got me excited - "Gatsby.js".
It's the amazingly fast static site generator that you never knew you needed.
It's got un-paralleled performance, amazing load times, a fantastic developer experience and awesome community! But you probably already knew that.

Recently we've been using Gatsby at [Clipchamp](https://clipchamp.com/en/company/careers) to create a really ambitious project.
While we've been pushing it to it's limits, we've gotten to see a different, more raw side of Gatsby. Here's just a few things that I think are amazing. 

## Plugin

## Contributor Kickbacks
I'm really suprised I haven't seen more open-source projects doing this! Whenever you add a new feature to Gatsby for the first time, [you recieve some swag!](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/contributing/contributor-swag/)
