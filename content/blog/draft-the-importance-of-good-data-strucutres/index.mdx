Data Structures are the crux of any piece of code.
We write to and from them, we search through them, we mutate them, all for the sake of better reflecting the situation our code models.
Unfortunately, not all data structures are created equal and different structures serve different purposes.

Too often, I see stuff like this:

```javascript
const data = [
    { key: 'one', value: 1 }
    { key: 'two', value: 2 }
    { key: 'three', value: 3 }
    { key: 'four', value: 4 }
    { key: 'five', value: 5 }
];

const key = 'three';
const { value } = data.find(x => x.key === key); // 3
```

It seems fine enough, but what is happening under the hood?
From the perspective of the JavaScript runtime, it looks a little bit like this:

1. Start search
1. Look at first element
1. Key is 'one' not 'three'
1. Look at second element
1. Key is 'two' not 'three'
1. Look at third element
1. Key is 'three', found it!

## Map

```javascript
const map = {
    one: 1,
    two: 2,
    three: 3,
    four: 4,
    five: 5
};

const key = 'three';
const value = map[key]; // 3
```
