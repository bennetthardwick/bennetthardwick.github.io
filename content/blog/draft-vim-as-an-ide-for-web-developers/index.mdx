title: Using Vim as a Web Development IDE
byline: I've traded in VSCode and started using neovim as my full-time IDE - here's what I learned.

Two weeks ago I decided to make the jump - finally changing from Microsoft's Visual Studio Code (Code) editor to Vim.
Despite months and months of strenuous [golfing](http://www.vimgolf.com/), there was always something in my road when I tried to change editors.

Namely, these things were:

- intellisense and language completion
- search (and replace) in files

Luckily, thanks to projects like [coc.nvim](https://github.com/neoclide/coc.nvim) and learning to love Vim's quick-fix-list and grepping features, they're no longer a problem.

## coc.nvim

CoC stands for "Conquerer of Completion", and is an intellisense and completion engine for vim and neovim.
It has a variety of extensions and a runtime that allows users to create extensions from Code's equivalents, meaning that you have the same completion power you would find in Microsoft's editor.

Needless to say I have found bugs here and there, but by-and-large, I've found the whole experience surprisingly seamless.

### Typescript Completion

After setting up CoC, the first plugin I installed was [coc-tsserver](https://github.com/neoclide/coc-tsserver).


### Angular Completion

## Search and Replace

## Other Great Features

### Windows and Tabs

When working with a lot of files, you need to be able to navigate between a lot quickly.

This is where windows and tabs come in.

In my work flow, multiple windows are used to arrange a contiguous or logical grouping of files.
Different groups of these files are set on different tabs.


```
<C-W>v      " vertical split
:buffer new " open buffer matching "new"
:Sexplore   " horizontal split explorer
:tabnew     " create new tab
:tabclose   " close tab
:close      " close window
:close      " close window
```

### Exploring Files

Vim has a great built-in file explorer called netrw.
Issuing `:Explore` will open netrw in the parent directory as the current file.
It can be very useful to create sibling files or directories.

```
:Explore  " open file browser
%         " create a new file
:w        " save file
:Explore  " open file browser
jj<CR>    " navigate and open file
```

### Folding Tags

When working with React, it's not always great to fold by syntax.
You might fold styles-components or functions or JSX.
Instead, when you want to just fold tags it can be a lot easier to manually create them yourself.

This can easily be done by selecting the tag in visual mode, an then folding:

```
vat     " select tag
:fold   " create fold
za      " toggle fold
za      " toggle fold
```
