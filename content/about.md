## Hello, Bennett here.

Iâ€™m a software developer living in Mackay, working on making cool things
in the browser at [Clipchamp.](https://clipchamp.com)

When I'm not at work, you'll find me ricing Archlinux, evangelizing Vim and spending hours and hours fighting the borrow-checker in Rust.

If you'd like to get in contact, you can send me an email at: `me at bennetthardwick.com`

I grew up on a sugar cane farm in rural north Queensland Australia, and ever since I can remember I've enjoyed building things.

In Grade 5 I was introduced to the world of programming through Scratch and Lego Mindstorms.
It took me a while to pick up, but after spending countless lunch-times inside the classroom, I got it to stick.

If only my 10 year old self could see me now - spending hours working on silly bugs, procrastinating by editing dotfiles and ricing Linux, and not letting my colleagues catch a breath before I tell them about my new favourite Vim trick - I'm sure he'd be proud.
