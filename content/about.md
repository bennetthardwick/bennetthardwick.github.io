## Hello, Bennett here.

I’m a Software Developer living in Brisbane, working on making cool things
in the browser at [Clipchamp.](https://clipchamp.com)

I’m still a full-time student, but you’ll barely find me at QUT. Rather,
you’ll probably find me breaking builds, ricing Archlinux or coming up
with ideas for apps I’m never gonna finish.

If you'd like to get in contact, you can send me an email at: `me at bennetthardwick.com`

I grew up on a sugar cane farm in rural north Queensland Australia, and ever since I can remember I've enjoyed building things.

In Grade 5 I was introduced to the world of programming through Scratch and Lego Mindstorms.
It took me a while to pick up, but after spending countless lunch-times inside the classroom, I got it to stick.

If only my 10 year old self could see me now - spending hours working on silly bugs, procrastinating by editing dotfiles and ricing Linux, and not letting my colleagues catch a breath before I tell them about my new favourite Vim trick - I'm sure he'd be proud.

### Stuff I Work With

- Visible Web Stuff (React, Angular, Vue)
- Hidden Web Stuff (Express)
- Gatsby

### Languages I Like
