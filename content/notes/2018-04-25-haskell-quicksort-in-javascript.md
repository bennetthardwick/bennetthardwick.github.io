title: Haskell Quicksort in JavaScript
type: text

Haskell is a really neat language! In fact, you can implement quicksort in [just one line](https://wiki.haskell.org/Introduction#Brevity).

While this is tremendously inefficient, I thought it would be fun to create a JS version of the one-liner, should I ever need it in an interview.

```javascript
const quicksort = ([h, ...arr]) => [h, ...arr].length
  ? [ ...quicksort(arr.filter(a => h >= a)), h,
      ...quicksort(arr.filter(a => h < a)) ]
  : []
```
