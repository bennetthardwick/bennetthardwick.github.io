A common task in Vim is replacing the current character with another.
Interestingly, you can even replace text with special character like line breaks.

```
this is some text
```

In `normal` mode, execute `r<Enter>`.
This will replace the current character with a line break and will leave you in `normal` mode.

```
this is
some text
```

Voila! That's it.
